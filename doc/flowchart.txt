To create a flowchart based on the pseudo code, we'd need to graphically represent each step and decision point. Here's a textual representation:

1. Start
2. Display the main greeting.
3. Display the menu to the user.
4. Get user input.
5. Decision: Is the input 1, 2, 3, 4, or 0?
	If 1: Execute Knowledge Base.
	If 2: Execute Media Controller.
	If 3: Execute Scheduler.
	If 4: Execute Voice Recognition.
	If 0: Call print_goodbye_message and end.
	Else: Display "Invalid choice" message.
6. Loop back to displaying the menu (step 3) unless the choice was 0.

For the print_goodbye_message:

1. Check if goodbye_messages is empty.
	If yes: Re-initialize it.
2. Select and remove the last message.
3. Display the message with a timed delay.
